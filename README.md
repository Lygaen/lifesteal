# LifeSteal

A very, very simple plugin that just 
contains the essentials for a LifeSteal
SMP.

## Setup
None !
All you need is to drop the file in your `plugins`
folder and the plugin will do the rest for you !

## Commands
There is only one command :
`/lifereset [player / me]` that will reset the
status of the player (when the player has no hearts
left, he will be PERMANENTLY set as spectator),
as well as his hearts.
